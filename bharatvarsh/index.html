            <h2>What is Sanatan?</h2> <br>
            Sanatan, derived from Sanskrit, means eternal or timeless. It signifies the ancient, unchanging principles
            of
            Hinduism, encompassing spiritual, moral, and social guidelines. Sanatan Dharma, often referred to as
            Hinduism,

            <h2>What is Bharatvarsh?</h2> <br>
            Bharatvarsh, also known as Bharata or Bharat, is the ancient Sanskrit name for the Indian subcontinent. It

            it's believed to be named after King Bharata, an ancestor of the epic hero Rama. Today, Bharatvarsh refers

            <h2>What makes Sanatan unique compared to other religions?</h2> <br>
            Hinduism stands out for its diversity, encompassing a vast array of beliefs, practices, and rituals. Unlike
            many religions, it lacks a single founder and promotes tolerance for various interpretations of
            spirituality. Its emphasis on karma, dharma, and moksha, along with concepts like reincarnation,
            distinguishes it from other major belief systems.
